@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral to generate a time base of 
one second with the corresponding Interrupt request.

    In this example TIM3 input clock (TIM3CLK)  is set to APB1 clock (PCLK1) x2,
    since APB1 prescaler is equal to 4.
      TIM3CLK = PCLK1*2
      PCLK1 = HCLK/4
      => TIM3CLK = HCLK/2 = SystemCoreClock/2
    To get TIM3 counter clock at 10 KHz, the Prescaler is computed as follows:
    Prescaler = (TIM3CLK / TIM3 counter clock) - 1
    Prescaler = ((SystemCoreClock/2) /10 KHz) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 180 MHz for STM32F4xx Devices.

The TIM3 ARR register value is equal to 10000 - 1, 
Update rate = TIM3 counter clock / (Period + 1) = 1 Hz,
So the TIM3 generates an interrupt each 1 s

When the counter value reaches the auto-reload register value, the TIM update 
interrupt is generated and, in the handler routine, pin MFX (connected to LED1 on board STM32469I-EVAL)
is toggled at the following frequency: 0.5Hz.

In case of error, LED3 is turned ON.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The connection of the LCD reset pin to a dedicated GPIO PK7 instead of the STM32F469 NRST pin may cause residual display on LCD with applications/examples that do not require display.
	  The LCD clear can be ensured by hardware through the board's power off/power on or by software calling the BSP_LCD_Reset() function.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F469xx/STM32F479xx devices.

  - In this example, the clock is set to 180 MHz.
  - This example has been tested and validated with STMicroelectronics STM32469I-EVAL RevC 
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.      

  - STM32469I-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1 connected to PK.03 pin (pin 16 in CN6 connector) and connect them on an oscilloscope 
      to show the Time Base signal.
